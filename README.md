# CodeAlpha-Multi_Player
Developed a Music Player as part of my CodeAlpha internship. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to upload songs from their device, play/pause, skip tracks, and enjoy smooth controls. The player features a clean UI, responsive design, and interactive elements for an engaging experience.
